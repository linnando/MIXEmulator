                MIX Emulator is a web-based emulator of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIX">MIX</a>, the
                mythical computer invented by Donald Knuth for his book series <a
                    href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html">&quot;The Art of Computer Programming&quot;</a>.
                The emulator supports assembling and executing programs for MIX, inspecting memory and register
                contents, working with (virtual) peripheral devices, and traversing execution flow in forward and
                backward direction. Programs may be executed in either the binary or the decimal mode (which differ in
                the byte size). Working with devices includes checking correct synchronisation of input/output
                operations: the emulator fails when the result of an operation is undetermined (e.g., on an attempt to
                write data to the memory block that is sent to a device without ensuring that the output operation has
                completed).
            </p>
            <p>
                The terminal device and floating-point operations are not supported currently.

                In order to use the emulator, enter the program text on the &quot;Program editor&quot; tab, choose the
                desired mode of operation and assemble the program. The emulator will switch to the &quot;Virtual
                machine&quot; tab. From there, you will be able to execute the program either step by step or until the
                end/next breakpoint is reached. Breakpoints may be set by double-clicking a program line on the
                &quot;Virtual machine&quot; tab (not in the editor currently). If you select the tracking mode, you can
                also move backwards in the execution flow. The &quot;Devices&quot; tab allows inspecting device data,
                downloading them as files or uploading files for using as input data. The device data are kept in the
                browser local storage.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another possible option is using an assembled program on punched cards with your own program loader (for
                example, to do exercise 1.3.1-26). If you want to do this, load a file containing punched cards data (in
                the character code) to device 16 and click the &quot;Go&quot; button. Please note that characters
                &#x03a3;, &#x03a0;, =, <, >, @, ;, :, and ' cannot be represented on punched cards. A macron (&macr;,
                U+0305) <em>after</em> a digit subtracts 20 from the character code (for example, if a punched card
                contains characters 0&macr;, the corresponding byte will have value 10 instead of 30). Of course,
                combining diacritics would be better to use, but it is not rendered well with monospace fonts:-(. A
                sample &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program on a punched card could look like:
            </p>
            <div class="card">
                <div class="card-body">
                    <pre> C Q7 A Q4   BEHELLO, W6¯RLD</pre>
                </div>
            </div>
