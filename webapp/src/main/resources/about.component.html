                MIX Emulator is a web-based emulator of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIX">MIX</a>, the
                mythical computer invented by Donald Knuth for his book series <a
                    href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html">&quot;The Art of Computer Programming&quot;</a>.
                The emulator supports assembling and executing programs for MIX, inspecting memory and register
                contents, working with (virtual) peripheral devices, and traversing execution flow in forward and
                backward direction. Programs may be executed in either the binary or the decimal mode (which differ in
                the byte size). Working with devices includes checking correct synchronisation of input/output
                operations: the emulator fails when the result of an operation is undetermined (e.g., on an attempt to
                write data to the memory block that is sent to a device without ensuring that the output operation has
                completed).

            <p>
                MIX opportunities that are not supported currently include the &quot;Go&quot; button, floating-point
                operations and other extensions.

                In order to use the emulator, enter the program text on the &quot;Program editor&quot; tab, then switch
                to the &quot;Virtual machine&quot; tab, choose the desired mode of operation and assemble the program.
                After that, you will be able to execute the program either step by step or until the end/next breakpoint
                is reached. Breakpoints may be set by double-clicking a program line on the &quot;Virtual machine&quot;
                tab (not in the editor currently). If you select the tracking mode, you can also move backwards in the
                execution flow. The &quot;Devices&quot; tab allows inspecting device data, downloading them as files or
                uploading files for using as input data. The device data are kept in the browser local storage.
