# MIX Emulator

MIX Emulator is a web-based emulator of [MIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIX), the mythical computer
invented by Donald Knuth for his book series
[&quot;The Art of Computer Programming&quot;](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html). The emulator
supports assembling and executing programs for MIX, inspecting memory and register contents, traversing execution flow
in both forward and backward direction. Programs may be executed in either the binary or the decimal mode (which differ
in the byte size).

MIX opportunities that are not supported currently include the &quot;Go&quot; button, floating-point operations and
other extensions. Development of a user interface for emulating peripheral devices is in progress (currently they are
supported at the virtual machine level only).
