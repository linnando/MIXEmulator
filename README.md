# MIX Emulator

MIX Emulator is a web-based emulator of [MIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIX), a mythical computer
invented by Donald Knuth for his book series
[&quot;The Art of Computer Programming&quot;](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html). The emulator
supports assembling and executing programs for MIX, inspecting memory and register contents, working with (virtual)
peripheral devices, traversing execution flow in both forward and backward direction, and checking correct
synchronisation of input/output operations. Programs may be executed in either the binary or the decimal mode (which
differ in the byte size).

MIX opportunities that are not supported currently include the &quot;Go&quot; button, floating-point operations and
other extensions.
